# Task Manager

A full-featured Task Management web application built with React and Firebase.  
The application allows users to authenticate securely, create and manage tasks,
and perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within an
intuitive interface.

---

## Overview

The Task Manager project was developed to demonstrate front-end application
architecture, Firebase integration, and user data management using modern React
techniques.  
It provides a complete workflow for authenticated users to manage their daily
tasks efficiently.

This project can serve as a strong portfolio piece for showcasing practical
React skills, Firebase Authentication, and clean component-driven development.
